### [2] `./agents/instructions/common/agent_task_preamble.md`

You are an agent triggered to perform a specific task. All required context — ticket description, PR diff, CI status, and related materials — has already been prepared in the `input/` folder. Your job is to follow the instructions below, read the prepared context from `input/`, and perform the work described. Do not ask for identifiers; the context is already available locally.

Read PR files to understand WHAT changed. Read ticket files to understand WHY it changed and verify against requirements.

### [5] `./agents/instructions/pr_rework/formatting_rules.md`

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    F1["outputs/response.md must be Markdown (# headings, - bullets, ``` code fences)"]
    F2["Required sections: ## Issues/Notes (if any), ## Approach, ## Files Modified, ## Test Coverage"]
    F3["Be surgical but thorough — fix exact issues flagged, then check same pattern across codebase"]
    F4["Do NOT refactor unrelated code or add unrequested features"]
    F5["When open PR review threads exist, create outputs/review_replies/*.md files and reference them from outputs/review_replies.json"]
```

- When `input/<TICKET>/pr_discussions_raw.json` contains open PR review threads:
  - Write one Markdown file per open thread under `outputs/review_replies/`.
  - Write `outputs/review_replies.json` with one entry per open thread, including `inReplyToId`, `threadId`, and a `reply` field that contains the path to the matching `.md` file.
  - Do **not** put reply bodies inline in the JSON.

### [6] `./agents/instructions/pr_rework/output_rules.md`

## PR Rework — Output Rules

Rework posts **only** to the Pull Request. All output must be Markdown.

### Required files

1. `outputs/response.md`
   - GitHub Markdown fix summary for the top-level PR comment.
   - Use `#`/`##` headings, ` ``` ` code fences, `-` bullets.
   - Required sections: `## Issues/Notes`, `## Approach`, `## Files Modified`, `## Test Coverage`.

2. `outputs/review_replies.json`
   - **Mandatory** when the PR has open review threads.
   - If there are no open threads, write `{ "replies": [] }`.
   - Format:

```json
{
  "replies": [
    {
      "inReplyToId": 1234567890,
      "threadId": "PRRT_<graphQL_id>",
      "reply": "outputs/review_replies/thread_1.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. `outputs/review_replies/*.md`
   - One Markdown file per open PR review thread.
   - The file path is referenced from `outputs/review_replies.json` via the `reply` field.
   - Keep each reply concise and factual; reference the fix location when possible.

Rules for review replies:
- Read `input/<TICKET>/pr_discussions_raw.json` to obtain each open thread's `threadId` and `rootCommentId` (`inReplyToId`).
- Create one reply entry and one `.md` file for **every** open review thread — do not skip any unresolved conversation.
- `threadId` is required for GitHub to resolve/close the conversation; `inReplyToId` is required to post the reply in the correct thread.
- Do **not** put the reply body inline in the JSON; use the `reply` field only as a file path reference.

## DMTools CLI — External Data Access

> **PR Review note**: Ticket/PR context is pre-loaded. Use dmtools only for additional data (e.g., parent story details, linked tickets not in input/).

Use `dmtools` CLI only when data is **not** already in `input/`.
