### [2] `./agents/instructions/common/agent_task_preamble.md`

You are an agent triggered to perform a specific task. All required context — ticket description, PR diff, CI status, and related materials — has already been prepared in the `input/` folder. Your job is to follow the instructions below, read the prepared context from `input/`, and perform the work described. Do not ask for identifiers; the context is already available locally.

## 1. Input context — MANDATORY reading order

```mermaid

    subgraph PR_CONTEXT["⚠️ PR-specific files (read first)"]
        P1["1️⃣ instruction.md (repo root) — project stack, conventions"]
        P2["2️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_info.md — PR title, author, branch, description"]
        P3["3️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_diff.txt — the diff to review"]
        P4["4️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_files.txt — list of changed files"]
        P5["5️⃣ input/TICKET/ci_failures.md — CI failures = BLOCKING"]
        P6["6️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_discussions.md + pr_discussions_raw.json — existing comments"]
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4 --> P5 --> P6
    end

    subgraph TICKET_CONTEXT["Ticket context (for understanding PR purpose)"]
        T1["7️⃣ input/TICKET/ticket.md — linked ticket description, ACs"]
        T2["8️⃣ input/TICKET/comments.md — ticket discussion if present"]
        T3["9️⃣ input/TICKET/parent-*.md — parent story context"]
        T4["🔟 input/TICKET/confluence/*.md — linked specifications"]
        T1 --> T2 --> T3 --> T4
    end

    subgraph RULE["⚠️ Rule"]
        R1["If file exists in input/ → read locally, do NOT re-fetch via dmtools"]
    end

    PR_CONTEXT --> TICKET_CONTEXT --> RULE
```

Read PR files to understand WHAT changed. Read ticket files to understand WHY it changed and verify against requirements.

## 2. Diff checklist — apply to `pr_diff.txt`

For every hunk, ask at least these questions:

- [ ] Does the change match the ticket scope? Any scope creep?
- [ ] Are new or changed public APIs contract-safe for existing callers?
- [ ] Is user/external input validated, sanitized, or escaped?
- [ ] Are secrets, tokens, or PATs handled safely — not logged, not interpolated into shell scripts?
- [ ] Are new or modified files present under `testing/` in a non-test-automation PR?
- [ ] Is dead code, unused imports, or obvious duplication introduced?
- [ ] Are error paths handled, or are failures silently swallowed?
- [ ] Are new dependencies justified and compatible with the existing stack?
- [ ] Beyond blockers: what other maintainability, correctness, or quality improvements are visible in the changed code?

## 3. Changed-file deep read

Do not review from the diff alone. Read the full content of every changed file:

- imports and dependencies
- class/method responsibilities and adherence to SRP / OOP principles
- naming consistency with the rest of the codebase
- error handling, logging, and edge cases
- test coverage for changed behavior
- backward-compatibility and migration impact

## 4. Impact analysis (CodeGraph or grep fallback)

Use CodeGraph to find "what could break":

- `codegraph_callers` / `codegraph_callees` on modified public symbols
- `codegraph_search` for: `PAT_TOKEN`, `secrets.`, `github.token`, `previousViewModel`
- `codegraph_impact` before flagging architectural changes

**If CodeGraph unavailable**, use grep and document it:
```bash
grep -rn "changedFunctionName" --include="*.ts" .
grep -rn "secrets\.\|github\.token" .
```

## 5. Review dimensions

Rate the PR across all relevant dimensions:

| Dimension | What to check |
|---|---|
| **Security** | injection, unsafe interpolation, secret leakage, missing permissions, unsafe defaults |
| **Architecture / OOP** | SRP, coupling, abstraction consistency, provider/repository boundaries |
| **Code quality** | naming, complexity, error handling, logging, comments |
| **Tests** | coverage for new/changed paths, meaningful assertions, no brittle string-only tests |
| **Duplication** | copy-paste, duplicated logic across files, duplicated configuration |
| **Backward compatibility** | public API changes, migration paths, default behavior |
| **Performance** | unnecessary rebuilds, heavy sync operations, missing timeouts |
| **Workflow / CI safety** | (when `.github/workflows/` changes) secret declarations, ref pinning, permissions, timeouts |

## 6. Severity classification

Classify every finding before writing outputs:

- **BLOCKING** — merge would cause a bug, security issue, data loss, or CI break. Must be fixed.
- **IMPORTANT** — real maintainability or correctness issue. Strongly prefer fixing before merge.
- **SUGGESTION** — optional improvement, style, or future polish. Does not block merge.

When in doubt, start one level higher; downgrade only after confirming the risk is negligible.

## 7. Exhaustive single-pass review

Treat **every** review as the final and only review pass. The author will not get another chance to catch missed findings cheaply.

- Do not defer SUGGESTION or IMPORTANT items to a later round because a BLOCKING issue exists.
- After classifying all findings, re-read every changed file and ask: *"What else is improvable here?"*
- Before writing outputs, verify that no obvious quality, maintainability, or correctness issue was left unreported.
- Aim to surface the maximum number of actionable findings in this single iteration.

## 8. Outputs

Write the standard review artifacts:

- `outputs/pr_review.json` — structured data with `recommendation`, `summary`, `inlineComments`, `issueCounts`
- `outputs/pr_review_general.md` — 1-2 paragraph general PR comment
- `outputs/pr_review_comments/*.md` — one file per detailed inline comment

Do NOT write `outputs/response.md`; the review is posted to GitHub only.

### [7] `./agents/instructions/pr_review/few_shots.md`

Example PR review outputs — keep concise:

### outputs/pr_review.json
```json
{
  "recommendation": "BLOCK",
  "summary": "SQL injection in UserService.js must be fixed before merge.",
  "generalComment": "outputs/pr_review_general.md",
  "inlineComments": [
    {"path":"src/auth/UserService.js","line":45,"comment":"outputs/pr_review_comments/comment1.md","severity":"BLOCKING"},
    {"path":"src/auth/LoginController.js","line":78,"comment":"outputs/pr_review_comments/comment2.md","severity":"IMPORTANT"},
    {"path":"src/utils/validation.js","line":23,"comment":"outputs/pr_review_comments/comment3.md","severity":"SUGGESTION"}
  ],
  "issueCounts": {"blocking":1,"important":1,"suggestions":1}
}
```

### outputs/pr_review_general.md
```markdown
## Automated Code Review — BLOCK

**Summary**: SQL injection blocks merge. One important issue (weak password validation) and one suggestion (extract duplicated validation).

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix SQL injection in UserService.js — use parameterized queries
2. Strengthen password validation (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
3. Extract shared email validation utility
```

### outputs/pr_review_comments/comment1.md
```markdown
🚨 **BLOCKING: SQL Injection**

User input is interpolated directly into the query at `UserService.js:45`:

```javascript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;
```

Use parameterized queries instead:

```javascript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?';
await db.query(query, [email]);
```
```

Use `dmtools` CLI only when data is **not** already in `input/`.
