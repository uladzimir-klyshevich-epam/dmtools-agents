You are an agent triggered to perform a specific task. All required context — ticket description, PR diff, CI status, and related materials — has already been prepared in the `input/` folder. Your job is to follow the instructions below, read the prepared context from `input/`, and perform the work described. Do not ask for identifiers; the context is already available locally.

### [5] `./agents/instructions/story_test_automation/general_guidelines.md`

# Story-level Test Automation Guidelines

You are automating a Story that has reached **Ready For Testing**. The Story already has linked Test Case tickets. Your job is to process **all linked Test Cases in one bulk run**.

## Workflow

1. Read the Story ticket and all linked Test Cases from `input/{STORY_KEY}/linked_test_cases.md`.
2. For each linked Test Case:
   - Check if an automated test already exists under `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/`.
   - If it exists, run it.
   - If it is missing, write a new automated test for it.
3. Produce a single result JSON: `outputs/story_test_automation_result.json`.
4. For every failed Test Case, produce `outputs/failed_description_{TC_KEY}.md`.
5. If environment/credentials are missing, produce `outputs/blocked.json` instead of running tests.

## Scope rules

- You may ONLY write code inside the `testing/` folder.
- Each Test Case must have its own folder under `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/`.
- Reuse components from `testing/components/`, `testing/frameworks/`, and `testing/core/`.
- Do NOT put raw Flutter/widget locators or `WidgetTester` code directly in the ticket test file.
- Every `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/` folder must contain:
  - `README.md` describing what is being tested.
  - `config.yaml` with test metadata.

## Output files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `outputs/story_test_automation_result.json` | Per-TC results and overall status. |
| `outputs/tracker_comment.md` | Human-readable summary for the Story ticket comment. |
| `outputs/failed_description_{TC_KEY}.md` | Full failure report for a failed Test Case. |
| `outputs/blocked.json` | Required when automation cannot run due to missing setup. |

## Result statuses

- `passed` — test ran successfully.
- `failed` — test ran and failed; a failed description file must be written.
- `skipped` — test cannot be automated (requires human-only verification); explain why.
- `blocked_by_human` — the whole Story is blocked by missing credentials/data.


---

### [6] `./agents/instructions/story_test_automation/output_rules.md`

# Story Test Automation Output Rules

## Mandatory JSON output

Write `outputs/story_test_automation_result.json` with exactly this schema:

```json
{
  "storyKey": "TS-123",
  "overall": "passed|failed|mixed|blocked_by_human",
  "summary": "Short human-readable summary of what was done.",
  "results": [
    {
      "testCaseKey": "TS-124",
      "status": "passed|failed|skipped",
      "testPath": "testing/tests/TS-124/...",
      "failedDescriptionFile": "outputs/failed_description_TS-124.md",
      "failureSummary": "One-line failure summary when status is failed."
    }
  ],
  "blockedReason": "Explanation when overall is blocked_by_human."
}
```

### Field rules

- `overall`:
  - `passed` — every result is `passed`.
  - `failed` — at least one result is `failed` and none are blocked.
  - `mixed` — some passed and some skipped, but none failed.
  - `blocked_by_human` — automation could not run due to missing credentials/data.
- `results` must contain every linked Test Case found in the input context.
- `failedDescriptionFile` is required for every `failed` result. It must point to a file under `outputs/`.
- `failureSummary` is required for every `failed` result.
- `testPath` is required for every non-skipped result.

## Mandatory tracker comment

Write `outputs/tracker_comment.md` in Jira wiki format. It should include:

- Story key and summary.
- Counts of passed / failed / skipped Test Cases.
- List of failed Test Cases with links to their failed description files (will be attached by the post-action).
- Any blockers or missing setup.

## Failed description files

For each failed Test Case, write `outputs/failed_description_{TC_KEY}.md` containing:

1. Test Case key and summary.
2. Steps to reproduce.
3. Expected vs actual result.
4. Stack trace / logs / screenshots if available.
5. Environment details.

Use Jira wiki markup (headings, code blocks, lists) so the file is readable when attached to the Test Case ticket.

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Separation** | Tests don't know about frameworks, only components |
| **Abstraction** | Components use interfaces, not concrete implementations |
| **Flexibility** | Easy to swap frameworks without changing tests |
| **Reusability** | Same business logic, different platforms |
| **Isolation** | Each test ticket has its own config and dependencies |

## OOP & Modern Practices

**Apply OOP throughout all test code:**
- **Single Responsibility** — each Page/Screen/Service object handles one domain area only
- **Dependency Injection** — pass drivers, clients, and config via constructor; never instantiate them inside components
- **Interfaces first** — all components implement contracts defined in `core/interfaces/`; tests depend on interfaces, not concrete classes
- **Encapsulation** — expose only high-level actions (e.g. `loginPage.loginAs(user)`), never raw selectors or HTTP internals

**Use modern, idiomatic frameworks:**
- **Web**: prefer Playwright over Selenium for new tests (async, reliable, built-in waits)
- **API**: use typed API clients with models — no raw `requests.get(url)` calls inline in tests
- **Mobile**: use Appium with Page Object Model; no hardcoded locators outside Screen classes
- **Assertions**: use framework-native matchers (e.g. `expect(locator).toBeVisible()`) — not manual boolean checks

**Test code quality:**
- No hardcoded URLs, credentials, or environment values — use `core/config/`
- No logic duplication — extract shared flows into components
- Tests must be deterministic: no `time.sleep()`, use explicit waits instead

```

## CI Credentials

Read project-specific CI/credential instructions if provided. Do not assume providers, project IDs, secret names, or test accounts. Report exact missing items in `outputs/test_automation_result.json`.

- `SOURCE_GITHUB_TOKEN` — available in CI jobs. Use for GitHub APIs or triggering workflows.

## Test Data — Generate Programmatically

```bash
# Minimal valid MP4 (1s, 1x1px, silent) — ~5 KB
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=black:s=1x1:d=1 -c:v libx264 -t 1 -movflags +faststart /tmp/test_video.mp4

# Minimal valid JPEG (1x1 white pixel) — 631 bytes
python3 -c "import base64, pathlib; pathlib.Path('/tmp/test_image.jpg').write_bytes(base64.b64decode('/9j/4AAQ...'))"

# Minimal valid MP3 (silent, ~1 KB)
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=mono -t 1 -q:a 9 -acodec libmp3lame /tmp/test_audio.mp3
```

## Test Data — Download Public Assets

```bash
curl -L -o /tmp/test_video.mp4 "https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4"
```

Always verify download succeeded (exit code 0, file size > 0).

## Test Data — Upload to Storage

```bash
<storage-cli> cp /tmp/test_video.mp4 <bucket>/test-data/{TICKET-KEY}/test_video.mp4
```

Use `test-data/{TICKET-KEY}/test_video.mp4` as `RAW_OBJECT_PATH` in the test.

## Real User-Style Verification

Automated assertions are required but not enough. Also validate the scenario as a real user would experience it.

**UI/UX tests:**
- Exercise the actual user-facing flow, not only internal APIs
- Verify visible labels, messages, headings, button text, validation text, empty states
- Check text appears in the right context
- Prefer accessibility locators (role, label, visible text)

**API/background tests:**
- Verify externally observable outcome a user or client would rely on
- Do not stop at "request returned 200" if the test expects specific user-visible behavior

Include human-style verification in output summaries. Document in `outputs/tracker_comment.md` and `outputs/pr_body.md`:
- what was checked by automation;
- what was checked as a real user/human-style scenario;
- what was observed;
- whether it matched the expected result.

## Output Files

Write outputs per `test_automation_output_files.md`:
- `outputs/tracker_comment.md` — tracker-specific markup
- `outputs/pr_body.md` — GitHub Markdown
- `outputs/test_automation_result.json` — machine-readable status

If test **failed**, also write `outputs/bug_description.md` with reproduction steps, expected vs actual, and error logs.


---

### [9] `./agents/instructions/test_automation/test_automation_output_files.md`

# Test Automation Output Files

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All output files MUST be written to `outputs/` at the repository root** (e.g. `/home/runner/work/repo/repo/outputs/`).
Do NOT write them inside `input/`, `input/TICKET-KEY/`, or any subfolder of `input/`. The post-processing script reads from `outputs/` at the repo root — writing elsewhere means all results will be silently lost.

Run `mkdir -p outputs` first to ensure the directory exists.

Write separate files for separate consumers. Do not reuse one format for all destinations.

## `outputs/tracker_comment.md` — tracker ticket comment

Purpose: posted to the Test Case ticket.

Use the tracker-specific markup format configured for the project (loaded via `cliPromptsByTracker`).
- For Jira trackers: use Jira wiki markup and follow `agents/instructions/tracker/jira_comment_format.md`.
- For Azure DevOps trackers: use GitHub-flavored Markdown and follow `agents/instructions/tracker/ado_comment_format.md`.

Required structure (render with the appropriate tracker syntax):

```text
### Test Automation Result

*Status:* ✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED / 🚫 BLOCKED
*Test Case:* KEY-123 — summary
*Test Branch PR:* link to PR (omit if not available)

#### What was tested
- Short factual bullet

#### Result
- What passed or failed
- If failed, name the failed step and actual issue

#### Test file
<code block>
testing/tests/KEY-123/test_key_123.py
</code block>

#### Run command
<code block>
pytest testing/tests/KEY-123/test_key_123.py
</code block>
```

When the tracker is Jira, write this content to `outputs/jira_comment.md`.
When the tracker is Azure DevOps, write this content to `outputs/response.md` (or `outputs/tracker_comment.md`) using Markdown syntax.

## `outputs/pr_body.md` — GitHub Pull Request body

Purpose: used by `gh pr create --body-file`.

Use GitHub Markdown.

Required structure:

````markdown
## Test Automation Result

**Status:** ✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED / 🚫 BLOCKED
**Test Case:** KEY-123 — summary

## What was automated
- Short factual bullet

## Result
- What passed or failed

## How to run
```bash
pytest testing/tests/KEY-123/test_key_123.py
```
````

## `outputs/response.md` — backward-compatible summary

If a platform still expects `outputs/response.md`, write a concise GitHub Markdown summary. The tracker-specific ticket comment must use the tracker markup file described above.

## `outputs/test_automation_result.json` — machine-readable result

Write the structured status JSON exactly as described in `agents/instructions/test_automation/test_automation_json_output.md`.

## Examples

### Passed
```json
{ "status": "passed" }
```

### Failed
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "bug": {
    "summary": "Bug: [what failed, max 120 chars]",
    "description": "outputs/bug_description.md",
    "priority": "High"
  }
}
```

### Blocked by Human
```json
{
  "status": "blocked_by_human",
  "blocked_reason": "Missing TEST_USER_EMAIL secret — automated test user not configured.",
  "missing": [
    { "type": "secret", "name": "TEST_USER_EMAIL", "description": "Automated test user email", "how_to_add": "gh secret set TEST_USER_EMAIL --body value --repo OWNER/REPO" }
  ]
}
```

## Detailed Examples (with counts)

The `status` field is the only required field. Additional fields help reporting but are optional.

### Passed (with counts)
```json
{ "status": "passed", "passed": 1, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0, "summary": "1 passed, 0 failed" }
```

### Failed (with error detail)
```json
{ "status": "failed", "passed": 0, "failed": 1, "skipped": 0, "summary": "0 passed, 1 failed", "error": "AssertionError: <exact error message>" }
```

The `"status"` field **must** be exactly `"passed"` or `"failed"` (lowercase). Missing or wrong field name causes the pipeline to break.

## Bug Description Template (when FAILED)

Use tracker-specific format:
- `h4. Environment`
- `h4. Steps to Reproduce` (numbered)
- `h4. Expected Result`
- `h4. Actual Result`
- `h4. Logs / Error Output` (`{code}` block)
- `h4. Notes` (optional)

### [11] `./agents/prompts/story_test_automation_prompt.md`

> Role: Senior QA Automation Engineer
> Task: Bulk automate/run all Test Cases linked to a Story that is Ready For Testing.

## Context files you must read

- `input/{STORY_KEY}/ticket.md` — Story details, acceptance criteria, solution.
- `input/{STORY_KEY}/linked_test_cases.md` — all linked Test Cases with key, summary, description, priority, and existing status.
- `input/{STORY_KEY}/linked_test_cases.json` — machine-readable version of the above.
- `testing/` — existing reusable components, frameworks, core helpers, and previously automated tests.

## Task steps

1. Run `codegraph context "{STORY_KEY} test automation existing tests and reusable helpers"` before grepping files.
2. For each linked Test Case `{TC_KEY}`:
   - Check `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/`.
   - If it exists, run the test and record the result.
   - If it is missing, write a new automated test following the architecture rules.
3. After running/writing, re-run any failed test at least once to confirm it is a real failure (not a flaky environment issue).
4. Write `outputs/story_test_automation_result.json` with the exact schema from the output rules.
5. Write `outputs/tracker_comment.md` summarizing the bulk run.
6. For each failed Test Case, write `outputs/failed_description_{TC_KEY}.md`.

## Important rules

- One Story = one branch `test/{STORY_KEY}` and one PR.
- All test code lives under `testing/`.
- Do NOT modify feature code.
- Reuse existing helpers; do not duplicate infrastructure.
- If credentials or test data are missing, stop and write `outputs/blocked.json`.
- Each new `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/` folder must contain `README.md` and `config.yaml`.

> **PR Review note**: Ticket/PR context is pre-loaded. Use dmtools only for additional data (e.g., parent story details, linked tickets not in input/).

Use `dmtools` CLI only when data is **not** already in `input/`.

# Jira tracker comment

Use Jira wiki markup in `outputs/response.md`.

- Headings: `h1.`, `h2.`, `h3.`
- Bullets: `* item`
- Numbered lists: `# item`
- Bold: `*text*`
- Inline code: `{{code}}`
- Code block: `{code}...{code}`
- Link: `[title|url]`

Do not use Markdown headings, fenced code blocks, or backtick inline code.

**IMPORTANT** When answering a clarification question about a user story, get the parent story for full context using: `dmtools jira_get_ticket PARENT-KEY` (the parent key is visible in the ticket's parent field).

### Tracker: `ado`

#### [1] `./agents/instructions/tracker/ado_comment_format.md`

# ADO tracker comment

- Tables: standard GFM table syntax

Do not use Jira wiki markup (`h1.`, `*text*`, `{code}`, `[title|url]`) in ADO fields.

**IMPORTANT** When answering a clarification question about a user story, get the parent story for full context using: `dmtools ado_get_work_item PARENT-KEY` (the parent key is visible in the ticket's parent field).

**IMPORTANT** When enhancing story descriptions, check child tickets and parent story for better context using: `dmtools ado_search_by_wiql`.
