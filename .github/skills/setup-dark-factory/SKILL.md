  Runbook for setting up a Dark Factory: an automated development repository
  where tracker intake (Jira is the common example), dmtools agents, GitHub
  workflows, branch protections, required quality gates, labels, and merge
  automation work together to deliver changes through PRs. Use when
  bootstrapping a new repo for autonomous development agents or troubleshooting
  why SM/intake/development agents did not start.

# Setup Dark Factory

## Definition

A **Dark Factory** is a repository setup where software delivery is driven by
tracker state instead of manual handoffs:

1. Product work enters through a tracker intake parent.
2. The SM agent scans tracker rules on a schedule.
3. Specialized agents refine, design, implement, review, rework, test, and merge.
4. GitHub quality gates protect `main`.
5. Labels and workflow runs provide locks, approvals, retries, and auditability.

The goal is not just "agents can run"; the goal is a closed automation loop:
**intake ticket -> agent dispatch -> PR -> required checks -> label approval ->
merge -> next tracker state**.

---

## Golden path

### 1. Create the product repository

Start with a normal repo that already has a clear product goal.

Required repo-level content:

```text
README.md                         # what the product is and how to run it
.dmtools/config.js                 # project-specific Dark Factory config
agents/                            # dmtools-agents submodule
.github/workflows/ai-teammate.yml  # runs one agent config
.github/workflows/sm.yml           # scheduled/manual SM loop
.github/workflows/merge-trigger.yml
.github/workflows/auto-update-prs.yml
.github/workflows/<quality>.yml     # required PR quality gates
```

Write the product goal before enabling automation. Agents need a target state,
acceptance rules, and project-specific context. Do not rely on generic prompts
to infer product intent.

### 2. Attach the agents repository as a submodule

Use `dmtools-agents` as the reusable automation layer.

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:IstiN/dmtools-agents.git agents
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

In GitHub Actions, checkout with submodules:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    submodules: true
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
```

Use a PAT if private submodules or cross-repo workflow dispatches are involved.

### 3. Configure `.dmtools/config.js`

Keep project-specific config in the target repo, not in `agents/`.

Minimum:

```js
module.exports = {
  repository: {
    owner: 'OWNER',
    repo: 'REPO'
  },

  jira: {
    project: 'PROJ',
    parentTicket: 'PROJ-1'
  },

  git: {
    baseBranch: 'main',
    authorName: 'AI Teammate',
    authorEmail: 'agent.ai.native@gmail.com'
  },

  scm: {
    provider: 'github'
  }
};
```

Add project prompts and instruction composition here:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  cliPrompts: {
    story_development: [
      './.dmtools/prompts/project_goal.md',
      './.dmtools/prompts/architecture.md',
      './agents/instructions/development/implementation_instructions.md'
    ],
    pr_review: [
      './.dmtools/prompts/review_focus.md',
      './agents/instructions/review/core.md',
      './agents/instructions/scm/github_pr_review_format.md'
    ]
  }
};
```

### 4. Prepare the tracker project

Create or choose:

- A tracker project key. Jira is the reference example in this skill.
- An intake parent ticket, usually an Epic or parent Task in Jira terms.
- Workflow statuses used by `agents/sm.json`.
- Required issue types: Task, Story, Bug, Subtask, Test Case.
- Custom fields required by your agents, e.g. Acceptance Criteria, Solution,
  Answer, Diagrams.

The default SM rules currently use these tracker statuses:

```text
Backlog
To Do
PO Review
BA Analysis
Solution Architecture
Ready For Development
In Development
In Progress
In Review
In Review - Passed
In Review - Failed
In Rework
Merged
Ready For Testing
In Testing
Failed
Bug To Fix
Done
```

Required issue types:

```text
Task
Story
Bug
Subtask
Test Case
```

Notes:

- `Task` is used for intake work under the parent ticket.
- `Story` and `Bug` are used for implementation work.
- `Subtask` is used for PO/BA clarification questions.
- `Test Case` is used for generated/automated testing work. If your tracker
  uses a different issue type name, override it in project config.

For Jira intake, verify the exact JQL before expecting agents to start:

```jql
project = PROJ
AND issuetype in ('Task')
AND status in ('Backlog', 'To Do')
AND parent = PROJ-1
```

`Backlog` and `To Do` are both accepted for intake tasks. If your tracker uses
another default status, override the SM rule in project config or align the
project workflow statuses.

### 5. Add GitHub workflows

#### `ai-teammate.yml`

This is the worker workflow. SM dispatches it with:

- `config_file`
- `encoded_config`
- `concurrency_key`
- optional `project_key`

It must provide:

- Tracker credentials. For Jira, this normally means `JIRA_EMAIL` and
  `JIRA_API_TOKEN`.
- GitHub PAT credentials.
- AI provider credentials.
- `SOURCE_GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.
- `SOURCE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.
- `DMTOOLS_INTEGRATIONS`.
- `CLI_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`.

Use `DMTOOLS_INTEGRATIONS` narrowly. For GitHub + Jira-backed tracker
automation:

```yaml
DMTOOLS_INTEGRATIONS: "jira,github,file"
```

Add `ai,cli,figma,confluence` only when the configured agents actually need
them. Do not leave obsolete providers like `ado` in a GitHub-only project.

#### `sm.yml`

This is the scheduled/manual orchestrator.

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/10 * * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:
```

It runs:

```bash
dmtools --debug run agents/sm.json --ciRunUrl "${CI_RUN_URL}"
```

Important: a new workflow file only becomes available for schedule/manual runs
after it is merged to the default branch.

#### `merge-trigger.yml`

Run merge retry after required checks succeed:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["<Required Checks Workflow Name>"]
    types: [completed]
```

It should run:

```bash
dmtools run agents/sm_merge.json --ciRunUrl "${CI_RUN_URL}"
```

#### `auto-update-prs.yml`

After `main` changes, update open PR branches so required checks can re-run on
up-to-date branches:

```bash
gh pr update-branch "$pr" --repo "${{ github.repository }}"
```

Expect this to skip fork PRs or conflicted PRs.

#### Required quality gates

Create a project-specific required-check workflow. The stack-specific commands
below are examples, not a strict template:

- Flutter: `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test --coverage`,
  golden tests, `flutter build web`.
- Node: `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run build`.
- Java: `./gradlew test build`.

Use a stable job name because branch protection references the job/check name,
not just the workflow filename.

Example for a Flutter project:

```yaml
name: Flutter Required Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  flutter-checks:
    name: Flutter checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # setup, analyze, test, build
```

In this example, the required status check in branch protection is
`Flutter checks`. A Java, Node, Python, Go, or other project should use its own
stable job/check name.

### 6. Configure GitHub secrets and variables

Secrets:

```text
PAT_TOKEN
TRACKER_EMAIL              # Jira example: JIRA_EMAIL
TRACKER_API_TOKEN          # Jira example: JIRA_API_TOKEN
GEMINI_API_KEY              # or other selected AI provider secret
COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN        # if using Copilot provider
FIGMA_TOKEN                 # only if Figma agents need it
```

Variables:

```text
TRACKER_BASE_PATH                         # Jira example: JIRA_BASE_PATH
TRACKER_AUTH_TYPE                         # Jira example: JIRA_AUTH_TYPE
TRACKER_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_FIELDS_TO_NAMES  # Jira example: JIRA_TRANSFORM_CUSTOM_FIELDS_TO_NAMES
TRACKER_EXTRA_FIELDS_PROJECT              # Jira example: JIRA_EXTRA_FIELDS_PROJECT
TRACKER_EXTRA_FIELDS                      # Jira example: JIRA_EXTRA_FIELDS
DMTOOLS_CACHE_ENABLED
GEMINI_MODEL
GEMINI_DEFAULT_MODEL
GEMINI_BASE_PATH
AI_AGENT_PROVIDER
COPILOT_MODEL
CURSOR_MODEL
PROMPT_CHUNK_TOKEN_LIMIT
```

GitHub does not expose secret values through the API. If migrating from another
repo, copy secret names via GitHub and source values from a local secure env
file or secret manager. Never print secret values in logs.

### 7. Protect `main`

Use a branch ruleset or branch protection rule.

Recommended for label-based Dark Factory approval:

- Require pull request before merging.
- Do **not** require human PR approvals if approval is represented by a tracker
  label such as `pr_approved`.
- Require status checks to pass.
- Require branch to be up to date before merging.
- Add the exact required job/check name, e.g. `Flutter checks`.
- Require conversation resolution if review threads are part of your review flow.
- Require linear history if you use squash/rebase merge.
- Block force pushes.
- Restrict deletions.

Do not enable deployment gates unless the deployment happens before merge.
Most product deploys run after merge to `main`; they should not gate PR merge.

### 8. Smoke-test the factory

Before trusting the factory:

1. Open a tiny PR.
2. Verify the required check appears and blocks merge until success.
3. Verify the required check succeeds.
4. Verify `merge-trigger.yml` runs after check success.
5. Add the expected approval label (`pr_approved`) to a test tracker ticket.
6. Verify merge retry behavior.
7. Create one intake child under the intake parent.
8. Run `SM Agent` manually.
9. Verify SM logs show the matching JQL and dispatch to `ai-teammate.yml`.
10. Verify the agent adds/removes lock labels correctly.

---

## Troubleshooting checklist

### SM ran successfully but no agent started

Check the JQL directly:

```bash
dmtools jira_search_by_jql \
  "project = PROJ AND issuetype in ('Task') AND status in ('Backlog', 'To Do') AND parent = PROJ-1"
```

Common causes:

- Ticket is in a tracker status not covered by the SM rule.
- Ticket is not a Task.
- Ticket is linked to the intake Epic but not a child via Jira `parent`.
- `.dmtools/config.js` points to the wrong `jira.project` or `parentTicket`.
- Lock label already exists, e.g. `sm_task_intake_triggered`.
- SM rule is disabled or overridden incorrectly.
- Workflow file was added in a PR but not merged to default branch.

### Agent workflow is not visible in Actions

GitHub only shows new workflow files after they exist on the default branch.
Merge the workflow PR into `main`, then refresh Actions.

### Required check does not appear on the PR

Check:

- Workflow listens to `pull_request`.
- PR targets the protected branch.
- The job has a stable `name`.
- Branch protection uses the exact check name, e.g. `Flutter checks`.
- The workflow file is on the PR branch and valid YAML.

### PR is blocked even though tests passed

Check:

- Required branch-up-to-date is enabled; update branch from `main`.
- Required status check name matches the actual job name.
- Another rule, code scanning gate, deployment gate, or human approval gate is
  enabled accidentally.
- PR comes from a fork and `gh pr update-branch` cannot push to it.

### Merge trigger ran but did not merge

Check:

- Tracker ticket is in the expected status, usually `In Review`.
- Tracker ticket has `pr_approved`.
- The PR can be found by ticket key in branch/title/body according to project
  config.
- Required checks are green on the current head SHA.
- Branch protection does not require human approval.
- `PAT_TOKEN` can merge PRs and bypass no required rule accidentally.

### Auto-update PR workflow failed

Common causes:

- `PAT_TOKEN` missing or lacks repo permissions.
- Branch belongs to a fork and is not writable.
- PR has merge conflicts.
- GitHub mergeability is temporarily `UNKNOWN`; retry later.

### Submodule checkout failed

Check:

- `actions/checkout` has `submodules: true`.
- Private submodule access uses `token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}`.
- The PAT has access to both the product repo and `dmtools-agents`.

### Secrets were "copied" but agents fail auth

Secret values cannot be read back from GitHub. Copying names is not enough.
Set values from a trusted local env file or secret manager.

---

## Typical mistakes

- Building a nice app/demo but leaving production data mocked.
- Copying project-specific tracker keys, statuses, repo names, or business rules
  into `agents/` instead of `.dmtools/config.js`.
- Forgetting that tracker default statuses differ by project. For Jira, `To Do`
  and `Backlog` are separate statuses even when they look similar in the board.
- Creating an Epic/intake ticket but not making child Tasks use it as `parent`.
- Leaving ADO variables/integrations in a GitHub-only repo.
- Requiring human PR approvals while the intended approval mechanism is a label.
- Protecting `main` before adding a required-check workflow with a stable job name.
- Using the workflow name as the required check when GitHub exposes the job name.
- Expecting scheduled workflows to run from a branch before merge to default.
- Forgetting `Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions -> Read and write`.
- Using `GITHUB_TOKEN` where a PAT is needed for submodules, cross-workflow
  dispatch, or protected operations.
- Not smoke-testing with a tiny PR before launching real intake.
- Not reading SM logs with `--debug`; a successful SM run can still match zero
  tickets.

---

## Minimal done criteria

A Dark Factory setup is not complete until:

- `.dmtools/config.js` resolves the correct repo, project, and intake parent.
- GitHub secrets/variables are present and verified without printing values.
- `ai-teammate.yml` can run manually for one config.
- `sm.yml` can run manually and scan the tracker successfully.
- Required PR checks block and then unblock a test PR.
- `merge-trigger.yml` runs after required checks pass.
- `auto-update-prs.yml` runs after `main` changes.
- One real intake child triggers an agent dispatch.
- Labels are used as locks and approvals according to the SM rules.
- `main` cannot be changed except through the protected PR flow.
