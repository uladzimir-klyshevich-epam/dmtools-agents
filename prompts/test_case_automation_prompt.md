**CRITICAL — linked bugs**: If `linked_bugs.md` is present in the input folder, read it carefully before writing any test.
- Read the **Solution** field and **AI Fix Comments** for each bug.
- If the fix introduced **timing or async behavior** (e.g., a heartbeat probe with a delay, a polling interval, a retry timeout) — your test **MUST** wait long enough to observe the effect. Do NOT assert immediately after triggering the action.
- Example: if a bug was fixed by adding a heartbeat probe that runs every 5 seconds, your test must wait at least 5–10 seconds after blocking auth domains before asserting the error appears.
- If the bug status is `Done` or `In Testing`, the fix is deployed — **run the test against the live implementation** and expect it to pass.

The feature code is **already implemented** in the `main` branch and **deployed**. Your job is to automate this test case — not to implement features.

If `merge_conflicts.md` is present in the input folder, the test branch could not be safely auto-aligned with `origin/main` before you started. Resolve this first: inspect the guidance, sync the branch deliberately with `origin/main`, prefer `origin/main` for setup/config/workflow/shared infrastructure conflicts, and keep only ticket-specific test automation that is still relevant. Do not open or leave a PR that is still dirty/conflicting with the base branch.

## Your task

0. Before inspecting `testing/` or any source file, run a targeted CodeGraph command such as `codegraph context "<ticket key> test automation existing tests and reusable helpers"`. Use CodeGraph for code investigation before `grep`, `find`, `cat`, `sed`, or opening files directly.
1. Analyze the Test Case: understand what needs to be verified, what type it is (web, mobile, API), and which framework fits best.
2. Check `testing/` for existing components (pages, screens, services) and core utilities you can reuse.
3. **Check if test already exists** in `testing/tests/{TICKET-KEY}/`. If it does, reuse and update it rather than rewriting from scratch. Only modify what is necessary.
4. Write the automated test in `testing/tests/{TICKET-KEY}/` following the architecture rules in `agents/instructions/test_automation/test_automation_architecture.md`.
5. **Run the test** and capture the result.
6. Perform a real human-style verification of the scenario from the user's perspective.
7. Write output files.

**You may ONLY write code inside the `testing/` folder.**

## Product defects and missing production capabilities

If the Test Case requires behavior that is missing or broken in the current production code on `main`, do not fake a passing result by pre-authoring the expected final state in fixtures or by weakening the assertions. Write the best test-only reproduction you can through the production-visible UI, CLI, service, repository API, or file format that the Test Case targets.

When that reproduction fails because production behavior is missing or broken, set `outputs/test_automation_result.json` to `"status": "failed"` and write a detailed `outputs/bug_description.md`. Missing product behavior is a failed test/product bug, not `blocked_by_human`; the downstream workflow creates or links a Bug from the failed Test Case.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: When the test FAILS — write a detailed bug report

If the test fails, `outputs/bug_description.md` **must** contain enough detail for a developer to reproduce and fix the bug without running the test themselves. Generic descriptions like "the test failed" or "element not found" are NOT acceptable.

**Required in `bug_description.md`:**

1. **Exact steps to reproduce** — copy the test steps from `request.md` and annotate each one with what actually happened:
   - Which step passed ✅
   - Which step failed ❌ and with what error/behaviour
   - What was on screen / in the response at the point of failure

2. **Exact error message or assertion failure** — paste the full stack trace or assertion output from the test runner, not a summary.

3. **Actual vs Expected** — be specific:
   - ❌ Bad: "the page did not load"
   - ✅ Good: "navigating to `/v/0097a85a-a616-4708-9dbd-8c2d81d47c38/` returned HTTP 404 and rendered the home page layout instead of the video watch page"

4. **Environment details** — URL, browser, OS, any relevant config values used during the run.

5. **Screenshots or logs** — if Playwright, attach screenshot path; paste relevant log lines.

The same level of detail applies to `outputs/tracker_comment.md` — the tracker comment must clearly state **which step failed and why**, not just "FAILED".

Do NOT create branches or push. Do NOT modify any code outside `testing/`.
