You are performing a focused rework of code based on Pull Request review feedback.

## Your Primary Goal

Fix **every issue** raised in `pr_discussions.md`. This is NOT a new feature implementation — it is a targeted fix pass addressing reviewer concerns.

## Merge Conflicts (resolve before anything else)

If `merge_conflicts.md` is present in the input folder, the branch was automatically merged with the base branch and has unresolved conflicts. You **must** resolve them first:

1. Check which files have conflict markers: look at `merge_conflicts.md` or run `git status --short`
2. For each conflicting file, open it and resolve every `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` block — keep the correct/merged content
3. Stage each resolved file: `git add <file>`
4. Verify no markers remain: `git diff --check`
5. Only after all conflicts are staged, proceed to the review fixes below

Do NOT run `git commit` or `git merge --abort` — the commit is handled automatically.

## Approach

1. **Read `pr_discussions.md` first** — list all review comments and threads before touching any code
2. **Be surgical but thorough** — before opening or editing any source file, run `codegraph context "<ticket key> <review issue and affected area>"`, even if the review already names an exact file, line, failing assertion, or test. Then fix the exact issue the reviewer flagged and use CodeGraph to find the same structural pattern across the codebase. Use `codegraph query`, `codegraph callers`, or `codegraph impact` when you know a symbol. Use `grep` only after CodeGraph when you need a literal string search. This prevents the same issue from being raised in the next review cycle. Do not refactor unrelated code or add unrequested features.
3. **Address BLOCKING issues first** (security, critical bugs), then IMPORTANT, then SUGGESTIONS
4. **If a SUGGESTION is minor and time-consuming**, you may skip it but explicitly note it in `outputs/response.md`

## Scope-Creep Review Loop Guard

If a reviewer blocks the PR because `pr_diff.txt` contains an unrelated deleted file, generated/cache artifact, tooling file, or other out-of-scope path, this is an actionable blocking issue even if it appears as a general PR comment instead of an inline thread.

Before writing a no-action response:
- Re-read `pr_diff.txt` and confirm the blocked path is no longer present.
- For deleted unrelated files, restore the file from the base branch or otherwise remove that deletion from the PR diff.
- Do not write "No open review comments" or "No new actionable items" while the blocked path remains in `pr_diff.txt`.
- If the same path appears in repeated review cycles, fix that path first to stop the loop.

## Rework Decision Flow

Use this flow before changing code so approved PRs that are only waiting for CI or merge checks do not enter a stale rework loop:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start PR rework] --> B{rework_setup_failed.md exists?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Write setup failure response and empty replies]
    B -->|No| D{merge_conflicts.md exists?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Resolve conflicts first]
    D -->|No| F{ci_failures.md exists?}
    E --> F
    F -->|Yes| G[Fix CI root cause]
    F -->|No| H{pr_discussions.md has open actionable items?}
    G --> H
    H -->|Yes| I[Fix every thread and write matching replies]
    H -->|No| J{Only waiting for fresh review, checks, or merge?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Write no-action response and empty replies]
    J -->|No| L[Write no-open-review-comments response]
    I --> M[Run relevant checks]
    M --> N[Write outputs/response.md and outputs/review_replies.json]
    K --> N
    L --> N
```

Approved PRs with no unresolved review threads are not rework candidates. If the PR is approved and required checks are still running, do not post another "Rework Complete" comment; the correct state is to wait for CI or merge automation.

## What You Must NOT Do

- Do not introduce new logic unrelated to fixing review comments
- Do not create new branches or push code — this is automated
- Do not change the ticket scope — you are fixing, not re-implementing
- Do not ignore any BLOCKING or IMPORTANT review comment

## Tests

After all fixes:
- Run the full test suite: compile and run all unit tests
- If any tests break due to your changes, fix them
- If the reviewer asked for new tests, add them

## Output — Two files required

### 1. `outputs/response.md` — Human-readable fix summary (posted as general PR comment)

Write in clear SCM-compatible Markdown:

```markdown
## Rework Summary

### Fixed Issues

**Thread 1 — `path/to/file.js` line 42**
- Issue: <what the reviewer raised>
- Fix: <what was changed and why>
- Files: `src/foo.js`, `src/bar.js`

### Skipped (with justification)
[Only if any suggestions were intentionally skipped]

### Test Status
[Pass/Fail + test changes made]
```

### 2. `outputs/review_replies.json` — Per-thread replies (posted as replies in each discussion thread)

For **every thread** in `pr_discussions_raw.json`, produce a reply entry.
Use the `rootCommentId` as `inReplyToId` and `id` as `threadId`:

```json
{
  "replies": [
    {
      "inReplyToId": 1234567890,
      "threadId": "PRRT_kwDOABC123",
      "reply": "Fixed: extracted validation into `InputValidator` class. See `src/validators/InputValidator.js`."
    }
  ]
}
```

- `inReplyToId` — from `pr_discussions_raw.json` → `threads[i].rootCommentId`
- `threadId` — from `pr_discussions_raw.json` → `threads[i].id`
- `reply` — short, specific description of the fix (1-3 sentences)
- Include an entry for **every non-resolved thread**, even if you only partially addressed it
- If `pr_discussions_raw.json` is absent or empty, write `{ "replies": [] }`

**IMPORTANT**: You are only responsible for code fixes and writing these two files — git commit, push, and posting to GitHub are automated.
