# Bug-level Test Automation Guidelines

You are automating tests for a Bug that has reached **Ready For Testing**. The Bug already has linked Test Case tickets. Process **all linked Test Cases in one bulk run**.

## Workflow

1. Read the Bug ticket and all linked Test Cases from `input/{BUG_KEY}/linked_test_cases.md`.
2. For each linked Test Case:
   - Check if an automated test already exists under `testing/tests/{TC_KEY}/`.
   - If it exists, run it.
   - If it is missing, write a new automated test for it.
3. Produce `outputs/story_test_automation_result.json` (shared schema).
4. For every failed Test Case, produce `outputs/failed_description_{TC_KEY}.md`.
5. If environment/credentials are missing, produce `outputs/blocked.json`.

## Focus for Bug tests

- Tests must reproduce the original bug scenario and verify the fix.
- Include regression checks: ensure the bug does not reappear.
- Use the same layer architecture as Story tests.

## Output files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `outputs/story_test_automation_result.json` | Per-TC results and overall status. |
| `outputs/tracker_comment.md` | Summary for the Bug ticket comment. |
| `outputs/failed_description_{TC_KEY}.md` | Full failure report for a failed Test Case. |
| `outputs/blocked.json` | Required when automation cannot run. |
